# createSelect.js

create-select ðŸ”—
create-select is a lightweight and framework-agnostic library that provides the core logic for creating searchable, multi-select, and async select components. Itâ€™s designed to work with any UI framework (React, Vue, Vanilla JavaScript, etc.) and leaves the UI entirely customizable by the developer.

The library offers powerful select functionality but does not impose any specific UI, allowing you to style and structure the component according to your needs, using Material UI, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, or pure HTML.

Features
Framework-agnostic: Works with React, Vue, Vanilla JS, and more.
Searchable: Easily filter options by a search term.
Multi-select: Supports single and multiple selections.
Async select: Fetch options dynamically based on search input.
UI flexibility: You control how the options and selected items are displayed.
